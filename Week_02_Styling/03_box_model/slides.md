##Nested Selectors

A block inslide a block (inside a block... etc).

Like Russian nesting dolls.

##Nested Selectors

---

##Normalize & Reset Files

Remember how I said that browsers have default styles for all HTML tags?

Well... there are all a _little_ different.

---

##Normalize & Reset Files

CSS files that you include on your page to reset the CSS to look the same on _all_ browsers.

Note:

* Include these files _before_ your own CSS.
* Group discussion: Why would we want to do this?

---

##Normalize & Reset Files

* [Reset.css](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)
* [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

Note:
* You only need one of these.
