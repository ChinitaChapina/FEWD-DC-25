# Git

* A version control program that saves the state of your project's files and folders.  
* Kind of like a backup system, but with history.
* Designed to allow more than one person to work on the same project.

---

# Repository

(a.k.a. __repo__)

A central location where data (i.e. your project) is stored and managed.

---

# Clone

(a.k.a. __pull__)

Download your project (repository) to your local machine

---

# Commit

(a.k.a. __push__)

Save a version of your project to Git.

---

# GitHub

A platform that makes it easy to manage Git repositories. 

* Stores files like Dropbox or Google Drive - primarily code.
* Stores a history of files and the changes that happens within each changed document.
* Hosts files on the cloud so you can share the finished product with other people.

---

# Why Github?

* Stores history
* Multiple developers can make changes to the same project
* Gives credit
* Allows users to give feedback on code

---

# Let's make a new repo!
