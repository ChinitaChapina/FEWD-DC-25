## CSS Frameworks

A CSS Framework is a set of CSS (and JS) files that are designed for developing easier, more standards-compliant websites.

---

## Why use a framework?

* Easier to code responsive sites
* Common elements that can be reused
* No reinventing the wheel

Note:
The common element of all of these frameworks is the grid.

## Grids

A __grid system__ is a set of measurements a graphic designer can use to align and size objects a webpage. 

Note:
Although there are a few different styles of grid systems, there are no strict rules on what can or cannot be a grid. It's up to you. Any guides that help you shape the final design is okay.
